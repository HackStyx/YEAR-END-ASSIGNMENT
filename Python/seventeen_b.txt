Pretty Print (pprint):

pprint is short for "pretty print." It's a module in Python's pprint standard library that provides a capability to "pretty-print" arbitrary Python data structures in a format that can be used as input to the interpreter.
Example:
from pprint import pprint

data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

pprint(data)
This results in a more readable and visually appealing representation of the data.

Pyperclip:

Pyperclip is a Python module that provides a cross-platform clipboard interface. It allows you to copy and paste text to and from the clipboard.
Example:

import pyperclip

# Copy text to clipboard
pyperclip.copy("Hello, clipboard!")

# Paste text from clipboard
clipboard_text = pyperclip.paste()
print(clipboard_text)
