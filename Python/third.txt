Strings: In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. It can include letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces. Strings are defined by enclosing characters within single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.

my_string = "Hello, World!"
1.Accessing Strings: Individual characters in a string can be accessed using indexing. Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first character is at index 0.

first_char = my_string[0]  # Accessing the first character, 'H'
2.Traversing Strings: You can traverse a string using loops like for to iterate over each character.

for char in my_string:
    print(char)
3.Slicing Strings: Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a string. The syntax is string[start:stop:step].

subset = my_string[7:12]  # Slicing from index 7 to 11, resulting in 'World'


Immutable Strings: Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. If you want to modify a string, you create a new one. This immutability provides some benefits, like efficient memory use and making strings hashable.
