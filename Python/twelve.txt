Exceptions: In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception.
Handling Exceptions:

Here's a simple program that generates an exception and demonstrates how to handle it:
try:
    x = 10 / 0  # This line will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
else:
    print("This block will be executed if there is no exception.")
finally:
    print("This block will be executed no matter what.")
The try block contains the code that might raise an exception.
The except block catches the specific exception (ZeroDivisionError in this case) and executes the code inside it.
The else block is executed if no exception occurs in the try block.
The finally block is always executed, whether an exception occurred or not.
In this example, a ZeroDivisionError is intentionally raised by attempting to divide a number by zero. The except block catches this exception, prints an error message, and then the finally block is executed.

Handling exceptions allows you to gracefully deal with errors in your program, preventing it from crashing and providing useful feedback.
