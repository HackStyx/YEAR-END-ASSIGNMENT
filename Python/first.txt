1.Values and Types:

Values: In Python, a value is a fundamental piece of data. Examples include numbers (e.g., 5, 3.14), strings (e.g., "Hello, World!"), and boolean values (True or False).
Types: Every value in Python has a type, which defines the kind of data it represents. Common types include int (integer), float (floating-point number), str (string), and bool (boolean).

value_integer = 5
value_float = 3.14
value_string = "Hello, World!"
value_boolean = True

2.Variables:

Variables: Variables are used to store and reference values in Python. You can think of them as named containers for data.

x = 10
name = "Alice"

3.Expressions:

Expressions: An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that can be evaluated to produce a result.

result = 2 + 3

4.Keywords:

Keywords: Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings. They cannot be used as variable names. Examples include if, else, while, and def.

if condition:
    # do something

5.String Operations:

String Operations: Python provides various operations for manipulating strings. Examples include concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

greeting = "Hello"
name = "World"
full_greeting = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
substring = full_greeting[7:]
