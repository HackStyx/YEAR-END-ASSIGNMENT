a. Accessing, Traversing, Updating, Deleting:

Accessing:

You can access the value associated with a key using square brackets.
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Accessing
name = my_dict['name']  # Retrieves the value 'John'
Traversing:

You can traverse a dictionary using a loop to iterate through its keys or key-value pairs.
for key in my_dict:
    print(key, my_dict[key])
Updating:

Update a value associated with a key.
my_dict['age'] = 31  # Updates the value associated with the 'age' key to 31
Deleting:

Remove a key-value pair from the dictionary.
del my_dict['city']  # Deletes the 'city' key and its associated value
b. Traversing a Dictionary Using a Loop:

You can use a loop to iterate through the keys, values, or key-value pairs of a dictionary.
for key in my_dict:
    print(key, my_dict[key])
Alternatively, you can use the items() method to iterate through key-value pairs directly.
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
