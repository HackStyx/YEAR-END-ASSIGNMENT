Dictionaries: In Python, a dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item in a dictionary has a key-value pair. Dictionaries are mutable, and keys must be unique.
Creating Dictionaries:

a. Using Curly Brackets:

my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
b. Using the dict() Constructor:

another_dict = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
Key vs. Value in Dictionary Element:

In a dictionary, the key is the identifier for a particular value, and the value is the data associated with that key. For example:

student = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'grade': 'A'}
Here, 'name', 'age', and 'grade' are keys, and 'Alice', 25, and 'A' are their respective values.
