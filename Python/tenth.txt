Tuples: In Python, a tuple is an ordered and immutable collection of elements. Once a tuple is created, its content cannot be changed (immutable). Tuples are defined using parentheses.
Creating Tuples:

a. Using Parentheses:
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')
b. Using the tuple() Constructor:
another_tuple = tuple([4, 5, 6])
Comparison between Tuple and List:

Mutability:

Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their content after creation. Tuples are immutable, and once created, their elements cannot be changed.
Syntax:

Lists are defined using square brackets, while tuples use parentheses.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
Performance:

Due to immutability, tuples generally have slightly better performance than lists in terms of iteration and memory usage.
Use Case:

Use lists when you need a collection that can be modified, and use tuples when you want to ensure that the data remains constant.
Both lists and tuples have their advantages and use cases. Lists are more flexible, while tuples offer performance benefits and immutability.
