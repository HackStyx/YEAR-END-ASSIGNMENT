
The scope of a variable refers to the region of the program where the variable is accessible or visible. In C, there are mainly two types of variable scope:

Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function are considered global. They can be accessed from any part of the program, including all functions.

Example:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int globalVar = 10; // Global variable

int main() {
    printf("Global variable: %d\n", globalVar);
    return 0;
}
Local Scope: Variables declared inside a function are local to that function. They can only be accessed within the block of code where they are defined.

Example:


#include <stdio.h>

void myFunction() {
    int localVar = 5; // Local variable
    printf("Local variable: %d\n", localVar);
}

int main() {
    myFunction();
    // printf("%d", localVar); // Error: localVar is not accessible here
    return 0;
}
