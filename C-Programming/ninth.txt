Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program. Here are a couple of common types:

Divide by zero: This occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero.

Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int denom = 0;
    int result = num / denom; // Division by zero

    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
In this example, attempting to divide by zero leads to a runtime error.

Accessing out-of-bounds memory: This happens when trying to access memory beyond the limits of an array.

Example:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    printf("%d\n", arr[10]); // Accessing out-of-bounds memory

    return 0;
}
In this example, accessing an element beyond the array bounds causes a runtime error
